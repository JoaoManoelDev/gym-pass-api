💡 In this API, I delved into the world of SOLID principles and discovered their vital role in creating a well-organized codebase. This experience clarified the importance of these principles, especially when it comes to scalability and maintenance.

🧪 Additionally, I had the opportunity to conduct comprehensive end-to-end and unit testing. This was pivotal in ensuring the robustness of the application, providing confidence in its performance.

🔐 Implementing JWT authentication and role-based access control was another crucial learning curve. This feature enhances security by allowing different levels of access based on user roles.

🔍 API Resources:
User registration and authentication
Profile retrieval
Check-in history and metrics
Gym search functionalities
...and more!

👥 User-Centric Security:
Encrypted passwords
Role-based access control
JWT Authentication

🛤️ Routes:
GET - /gyms/search: Search for gyms by name.
GET - /gyms/nearby: Discover gyms within a 10km radius.
POST - /gyms: Create a new gym (Admin access only).
POST - /users: Register a new user.
POST - /sessions: Authenticate and acquire a JWT token.
PATCH - /token/refresh: Renew the JWT token.
GET - /me: Retrieve the profile of the authenticated user.
GET - /check-ins/history: Access the check-in history of the authenticated user.
GET - /check-ins/metrics: Explore check-in metrics.

💡 Learning Highlights:
From diving deep into SOLID principles to rigorous end-to-end and unit testing, this journey has been a masterclass in backend development. The integration of JWT authentication and role-based access control brings an added layer of security and versatility to the application. I am happy and proud of the wealth of knowledge I have gained. I'm excited about the skills I'm currently acquiring in the project I'm working on and that I'll share with you all here in the future. 💪🚀
